# Face Sets to Face Maps Blender Add-on

This Blender add-on converts sculpt mode face sets into face maps with a single click. A demonstration of it's use is will be available soon. 

I created this script as a helper for the [Exocide Quad Remesher](https://exoside.com/quadremesher/) add-on, which can use face map information to create edge loops for automatic retoplogy. As of Blender 3.6, there is no quick way to convert face sets into face maps even though you can do the opposite in the face sets menu in sculpt mode. 

Once installed, the button to convert face sets to face maps will appear in the Quad Remesh tab of the N-panel in Object mode.
